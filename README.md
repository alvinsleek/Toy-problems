 Problem 1. Student Grade Generator

The project is a program that is meant to calculate grades of students upon given inputs of the marks scored by them.
Description
The user is prompted to input student marks which should be between 0 and 100.
The output should correspond the correct grade i.e
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

Problem 2. Speed Detector

The program is a code solution that checks on speed control through use of a function. The detector takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.


Problem 3.Net Salary Calculator

The program seeks to find a solution in calculating net salaries of employees through deducting tax deductions (NHIF,NSSF)from gross salary.
The program gets inputs of employees' gross salaries then calculates the PAYE according to the amount bracket it falls in, hence giving out the net salary
